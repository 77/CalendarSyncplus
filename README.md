# CalendarSync+

This project is inspired by our good old but dormant project OutlookGoogleSync.
This project aims to provide all the features provided to you by the old application but with a new and refresh look and feel (Metro)

The project tries to improve upon the bugs and well as provide new functionality.

We'll be posting about the current and the future feature updates regular.
Please try the application and report bugs/flaws/error. We are open to suggestions :)
